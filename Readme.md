# DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics

## Project Overview
The DataSpark project provides valuable insights into the global electronics industry. Using Python for data preprocessing, MySQL for efficient storage, and Power BI for visualization, it analyzes key metrics like sales performance, customer demographics, store efficiency, and product analysis. This helps businesses make informed decisions to optimize operations and strategies.

## Project Phases & Workflow
The project is structured into five primary phases: **Data Cleaning, Preparation & EDA**, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Data Storage & Integration**, and **Analysis, Visualization, & Product Insights**. Each phase ensures proper data processing, storage, and analysis for actionable insights.

### 1. Data Cleaning, Preparation & EDA
- **Objective**: Prepare raw data for analysis by cleaning and transforming it into a structured format.
- **Execution Steps**:
  - **Import Libraries**: Load essential Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
  - **Load Raw Data**: Import datasets containing sales, customer, product, and store information using `pandas`.
  - **Data Cleaning**:
    - Handle missing values using forward/backward filling and imputation.
    - Convert columns with non-standard formats (e.g., dates, monetary values) to appropriate types.
    - Normalize numerical columns like `Unit Cost USD` to remove symbols and ensure proper data types.
  - **Output**: Clean and structured datasets ready for EDA.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective**: Conduct a detailed analysis of the data to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- **Execution Steps**:
  - **Univariate Analysis**:
    - Analyze individual features like `sales`, `product price`, and `store size` using histograms, box plots, and summary statistics.
  - **Bivariate Analysis**:
    - Explore relationships between pairs of variables, such as `sales vs. store size` or `customer age vs. purchase frequency`.
  - **Multivariate Analysis**:
    - Analyze interactions between multiple variables to uncover deeper insights.
  - **Data Visualization**:
    - Use Python libraries like `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to create insightful visualizations.
  - **Key Outputs**:
    - Identification of high-performing stores, top-selling products, and customer segmentation patterns.

### 3. Data Storage & Integration
- **Objective**: Store the cleaned data in a relational database for structured querying and scalability.
- **Execution Steps**:
  - **Database Setup**: Use MySQL with SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL for database management.
  - **Data Import**:
    - Upload cleaned data to MySQL tables using `pandas.to_sql()`.
    - Set the `if_exists='replace'` option to ensure tables are updated with the latest data.
  - **Verification**: Confirm successful table creation and data integrity using SQL queries.
  - **Output**: Data is stored in MySQL, ready for advanced queries and visualization.

### 4. Analysis, Visualization, & Product Insights
- **Objective**: Analyze and visualize data to uncover insights on store performance, customer behavior, sales trends, and product analysis.
- **Execution Steps**:
  - **Store Performance Analysis**:
    - Evaluate store efficiency by analyzing `sales` by `store size`, `location`, and `age`.
    - Identify factors driving high performance in specific stores.
  - **Customer Insights**:
    - Segment customers based on `purchase frequency` and `average order value`.
    - Analyze customer demographics like `age`, `gender`, and `location` to create targeted marketing strategies.
  - **Sales Trends**:
    - Track sales trends over time and identify top-selling products and categories.
  - **Product Analysis**:
    - Identify top-selling products and categories based on sales value and profit margins.
    - Analyze product performance across regions to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.
    - Highlight high-margin products for targeted promotions.
  - **Output**: Insights visualized in Power BI dashboards, including store, customer,sales and product performance.

## Key Insights
1. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Customers segmented by purchase frequency, order value, and demographics allow personalized marketing.
2. **Store Performance**:
   - Insights into store success factors (e.g., location, size, age) help improve operational efficiency.
3. **Sales Patterns**:
   - Data on product trends and regional performance guides inventory and marketing strategies.
4. **Product Performance**:
   - Focus on high-demand, high-margin products ensures better profitability.
5. **Growth Opportunities**:
   - Recommendations for store expansions, product launches, and customer engagement.
